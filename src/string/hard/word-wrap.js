/**
 * Arrange words in a sequence to minimize the total cost based on line breaks and extra spaces.
 *
 * Given a sequence of words and a limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width),
 * arrange the words to minimize the total cost where cost of each line is calculated as (Number of extra spaces)^2.
 *
 * @param {number[]} wordLengths - Array where each element represents the length of a word.
 * @returns {number[]} - Array of integers representing the starting and ending word indices for each line.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 1:
 * // Input: wordLengths = [3, 2, 2, 5]
 * // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
 * // Explanation:
 * // Line 1: From word no. 1 to 1
 * // Line 2: From word no. 2 to 3
 * // Line 3: From word no. 4 to 4
 *
 * // Example 2:
 * // Input: wordLengths = [3, 2, 2]
 * // Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
 * // Explanation:
 * // Line 1: From word no. 1 to 1
 * // Line 2: From word no. 2 to 2
 * // Line 3: From word no. 3 to 3
