/**
 * Problem:
 * Given a string S, find the length of the longest balanced subsequence in it.
 * A balanced string is defined as:
 * - A null string is a balanced string.
 * - If X and Y are balanced strings, then (X)Y and XY are balanced strings.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: S = "()())"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: "()()" is the longest balanced subsequence of length 4.
 *
 * Input: s = "()(((((()"
 * Output: 4
 *
 * @param {string} S The input string.
 * @returns {number} The length of the longest balanced subsequence.
