/**
 * What is the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)?
 *
 * The BWT is a data transformation algorithm that restructures data in such a way
 * that the transformed message is more compressible. Technically, it is a
 * lexicographical reversible permutation of the characters of a string. It is
 * the first of the three steps to be performed in succession while implementing
 * the Burrows-Wheeler Data Compression algorithm that forms the basis of the
 * Unix compression utility bzip2.
 *
 * Why BWT? The main idea behind it:
 *
 * The most important application of BWT is found in biological sciences where
 * genomes (long strings written in A, C, T, G alphabets) donâ€™t have many runs
 * but they do have many repeats. The idea of the BWT is to build an array whose
 * rows are all cyclic shifts of the input string in dictionary order and return
 * the last column of the array that tends to have long runs of identical
 * characters. The benefit of this is that once the characters have been
 * clustered together, they effectively have an ordering, which can make our
 * string more compressible for other algorithms like run-length encoding and
 * Huffman Coding. The remarkable thing about BWT is that this particular
 * transform is reversible with minimal data overhead.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: text = "banana$"
 * Output: Burrows-Wheeler Transform = "annb$aa"
 *
 * Input: text = "abracadabra$"
 * Output: Burrows-Wheeler Transform = "ard$rcaaaabb"
 *
 * @param {string} text The input text string to apply the Burrows-Wheeler Transform.
 * @returns {string} The Burrows-Wheeler Transform of the input text.
