/**
 * Problem:
 * You are given a string of 2N characters consisting of N '[' brackets and N ']' brackets.
 * A string is considered balanced if it can be represented in the form S2[S1] where S1 and S2 are balanced strings.
 * Calculate the minimum number of swaps necessary to make a string balanced.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: "[]][]["
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * First swap: Position 3 and 4
 * [][]][
 * Second swap: Position 5 and 6
 * [][][]
 *
 * Input: "[[][]]"
 * Output: 0
 * The string is already balanced.
 *
 * @param {string} str The input string consisting of '[' and ']' characters.
 * @returns {number} The minimum number of swaps required to balance the string.
