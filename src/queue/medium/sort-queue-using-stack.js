/**
 * Checks if a queue consisting of the first n natural numbers can be sorted into another queue
 * using a stack.
 *
 * The function uses a stack to temporarily hold elements while rearranging them into a sorted order
 * in the output queue. It processes elements from the input queue and determines if they can be
 * rearranged in increasing order using the stack and another queue.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: queue = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The queue can be sorted by pushing 5 onto the stack and then pushing 1, 2, 3, 4
 * directly to the output queue. Finally, pop 5 from the stack and push it to the output queue,
 * resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: queue = [5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The queue cannot be sorted because after pushing 5 and 6 onto the stack, the elements
 * 1, 2, 3, 4 must be placed in increasing order, but 5 cannot be placed after 6 as it is on the stack.
 * Thus, the output queue cannot be sorted as desired.
 *
 * @param {number[]} queue - The input queue consisting of natural numbers in random order.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the queue can be sorted into another queue using a stack, otherwise false.
