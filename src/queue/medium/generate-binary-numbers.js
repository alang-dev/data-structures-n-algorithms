/**
 * Generates and prints all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to N.
 *
 * The function converts each decimal number from 1 to N into its binary representation
 * and returns them as an array of binary strings.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: ['1', '10']
 * Explanation: The binary numbers from 1 to 2 are '1' and '10'.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: ['1', '10', '11', '100', '101']
 * Explanation: The binary numbers from 1 to 5 are '1', '10', '11', '100', and '101'.
 *
 * @param {number} n - The upper limit of the range to generate binary numbers.
 * @returns {string[]} An array of binary number strings from 1 to N.
