/**
 * Finds the minimum number of steps a knight needs to reach a target position on an N x N chessboard.
 *
 * The function uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the knight's
 * starting position to the target position on a chessboard.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: N = 8, start = [0, 0], target = [7, 7]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The knight requires a minimum of 6 moves to reach from (0,0) to (7,7) on an 8x8 board.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: N = 8, start = [1, 1], target = [4, 4]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The knight requires a minimum of 3 moves to reach from (1,1) to (4,4) on an 8x8 board.
 *
 * @param {number} N - The size of the chessboard (N x N).
 * @param {number[]} start - The starting position of the knight as [row, col].
 * @param {number[]} target - The target position as [row, col].
 * @returns {number} The minimum number of steps required for the knight to reach the target position.
