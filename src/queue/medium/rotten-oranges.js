/**
 * Computes the minimum time required for all oranges in the matrix to rot. A rotten orange at position (i, j)
 * can rot fresh oranges that are its neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If it is impossible to rot every
 * orange, the function returns -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 *   arr = [
 *     [2, 1, 0, 2, 1],
 *     [1, 0, 1, 2, 1],
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]
 *   ]
 * Output:
 *   2
 * Explanation:
 *   - At time 0:
 *     [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]
 *     [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]
 *   - At time 1:
 *     [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]
 *     [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]
 *   - At time 2:
 *     [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]
 *     [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]
 *     [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]
 *   All oranges are rotten by time 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 *   arr = [
 *     [2, 1, 0, 2, 1],
 *     [0, 0, 1, 2, 1],
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]
 *   ]
 * Output:
 *   -1
 * Explanation:
 *   - At time 0:
 *     [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]
 *     [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]
 *   - At time 1:
 *     [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]
 *     [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]
 *   - At time 2:
 *     [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]
 *     [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
 *     [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]
 *   The 1 at the bottom left corner of the matrix is never rotten, so not all oranges can be rotted.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} arr - The matrix representing the grid of oranges. Each cell can be 0 (empty), 1 (fresh), or 2 (rotten).
 * @returns {number} - The minimum time required to rot all the oranges. Returns -1 if it's impossible.
