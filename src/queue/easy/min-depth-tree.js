/**
 * Finds the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root - The root of the binary tree.
 * @returns {number} The minimum depth of the binary tree. If the tree is empty, returns 0.
 *
 * @example
 * // Input: root = [1, 2, 3, null, 4]
 * // Output: 2
 * // Explanation: The minimum depth is from root (1) to the leaf (3).
 *
 * @example
 * // Input: root = [1, 2, null, 3, null, 4]
 * // Output: 3
 * // Explanation: The minimum depth is from root (1) to the leaf (4).
