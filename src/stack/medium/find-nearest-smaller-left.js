/**
 * @file find-nearest-smaller-left.js
 * @description Function to find the nearest smaller number on the left side for each element in the array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The input array of integers.
 * @returns {number[]} - An array containing the nearest smaller numbers on the left side for each element in the input array.
 *
 * @example
 * findNearestSmallerLeft([1, 6, 4, 10, 2, 5]);
 * // Returns: [undefined, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2]
 * // Explanation:
 * // For 1, there's no smaller element on the left side, so it's undefined.
 * // For 6, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 1.
 * // For 4, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 1.
 * // For 10, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 4.
 * // For 2, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 1.
 * // For 5, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 2.
 *
 * findNearestSmallerLeft([1, 3, 0, 2, 5]);
 * // Returns: [undefined, 1, undefined, 0, 2]
 * // Explanation:
 * // For 1, there's no smaller element on the left side, so it's undefined.
 * // For 3, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 1.
 * // For 0, there's no smaller element on the left side, so it's undefined.
 * // For 2, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 0.
 * // For 5, the nearest smaller element on the left side is 2.
