/**
 * @file next-smaller-of-next-greater.js
 * @description Finds the Next Smaller of Next Greater Element for each element in an array.
 *
 * For each element in the array, find the next greater element to its right and then find the next smaller element
 * to the right of that next greater element.
 * If no such elements exist, the result for that element is -1.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The array for which the result needs to be computed.
 * @returns {number[]} - An array where each element represents the next smaller of next greater element.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 1
 * // Input: [5, 1, 9, 2, 5, 1, 7]
 * // Output: [2, 2, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1]
 * // Explanation:
 * // For 5, next greater is 9, next smaller of 9 is 2.
 * // For 1, next greater is 9, next smaller of 9 is 2.
 * // For 9, no greater element exists, so output is -1.
 * // For 2, next greater is 5, next smaller of 5 is 1.
 * // For 5, next greater is 7, next smaller of 7 is -1.
 * // For 1, next greater is 7, next smaller of 7 is -1.
 * // For 7, no greater element exists, so output is -1.
 * const result1 = nextSmallerOfNextGreater([5, 1, 9, 2, 5, 1, 7]);
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 2
 * // Input: [4, 8, 2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 3]
 * // Output: [2, 5, 5, 5, -1, 3, -1, -1]
 * // Explanation:
 * // For 4, next greater is 8, next smaller of 8 is 2.
 * // For 8, next greater is 9, next smaller of 9 is 5.
 * // For 2, next greater is 5, next smaller of 5 is 5.
 * // For 1, next greater is 9, next smaller of 9 is 5.
 * // For 9, no greater element exists, so output is -1.
 * // For 5, next greater is 6, next smaller of 6 is 3.
 * // For 6, no greater element exists, so output is -1.
 * // For 3, no greater element exists, so output is -1.
 * const result2 = nextSmallerOfNextGreater([4, 8, 2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 3]);
