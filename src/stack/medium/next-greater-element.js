/**
 * @file next-greater-element.js
 * @description Finds the Next Greater Element (NGE) for each element in an array.
 *
 * The Next Greater Element for an element `x` is the first greater element to the right of `x` in the array.
 * If no such element exists, the NGE is -1.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The array for which the NGE needs to be found.
 * @returns {number[]} - An array where each element represents the NGE of the corresponding element in the input array.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 1
 * // Input: [4, 5, 2, 25]
 * // Output: [5, 25, 25, -1]
 * // Explanation:
 * // 4 -> 5 (5 is the first greater element to the right of 4)
 * // 5 -> 25 (25 is the first greater element to the right of 5)
 * // 2 -> 25 (25 is the first greater element to the right of 2)
 * // 25 -> -1 (No element greater than 25 exists to its right)
 * const result1 = nextGreaterElement([4, 5, 2, 25]);
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 2
 * // Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]
 * // Output: [-1, 12, 12, -1]
 * // Explanation:
 * // 13 -> -1 (No element greater than 13 exists to its right)
 * // 7 -> 12 (12 is the first greater element to the right of 7)
 * // 6 -> 12 (12 is the first greater element to the right of 6)
 * // 12 -> -1 (No element greater than 12 exists to its right)
 * const result2 = nextGreaterElement([13, 7, 6, 12]);
