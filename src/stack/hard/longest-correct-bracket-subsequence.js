/**
 * Finds the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence within a given query range.
 * A correct bracket subsequence is defined by matched bracket pairs or nested correct sequences.
 *
 * @param {string} S - The bracket sequence.
 * @param {number} startIndex - The start index of the range (inclusive).
 * @param {number} endIndex - The end index of the range (inclusive).
 * @returns {number} The length of the longest correct bracket subsequence in the given range.
 *
 * @example
 * // Input: S = "())(())(())(", startIndex = 0, endIndex = 11
 * // Output: 10
 * // Explanation: Longest Correct Bracket Subsequence is ()(())(())
 *
 * @example
 * // Input: S = "())(())(())(", startIndex = 1, endIndex = 2
 * // Output: 0
 * // Explanation: There is no correct bracket subsequence in the range.
