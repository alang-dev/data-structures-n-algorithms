/**
 * A data structure that supports insertion, deletion, and getting a random element with duplicates allowed.
 *
 * The operations supported are:
 * - `insert(x)`: Inserts the value `x` into the data structure. Returns true if `x` was not present, false if it was already present.
 * - `remove(x)`: Removes one instance of `x` from the data structure if present.
 * - `getRandom()`: Returns a random value from the data structure, where the probability of each element being returned is proportional to its frequency.
 *
 * The time complexity for `insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom` operations is O(1).
